# This is a working AI & ML test program which uses CNN and tensors to identify type of an animal or a person. 
# This model has been trained on about 90 different types of random animals (60 images each) and 2 people's about 240 images combined
# this is kind of a miniscule training data so dont expect too much. As more and more data gets available to the program, smarter it gets
